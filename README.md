# jamfMessenger
A templetized shell script framework for use with jamfHelper.

Provides a cookie-cutter jamfHelper pop-up window creation with a consistent look and feel for all your pop-up needs.

* Contains ALL the jamfHelper options and flags
  * Does not include the launchD function with delay and kill flags as this feature never seemed to work in jamfHelper and is possibly deprecated in current versions anyway
* Provides UNICODE support for colorful pop-up windows with jamfHelper
* Provides web URL support for pop-up window icons
